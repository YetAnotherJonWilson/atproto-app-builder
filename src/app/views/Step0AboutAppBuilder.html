  <h2 class="step-header">&ThinSpace;THE APP BUILDER&ThinSpace;</h2>
  <p>
    In the following steps, we'll build a
    <strong>decentralized web app</strong>, which is a web page or application
    where:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>You login with an identity that you own</li>
    <li>The app uses data from a source that you own</li>
  </ol>
  <h2>Some examples are:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      A meditation app with a timer and sound settings, that tracks your
      sessions.
    </li>
    <li>
      A grocery list app that you might share with your family or roommates.
    </li>
    <li>
      An event-planning app that helps with organization, tracking RSVP's,
      schedules, and tasks.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Using the AT Protocol, you can:</h2>
  <ol style="margin: 0; padding-left: 1.5rem">
    <li style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem">
      <strong>Login/logout:</strong> <br />
      This step will be mostly handled for you by existing libraries.
    </li>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem">
      <strong>Retrieve data from one or more Personal Data Servers:</strong>
      <br />
      Think about what data you need in your app, and how you will define it. In
      ATProtocol applications, your data exists as Records and Properties on
      those records. For example, an item on a todo list might be a Record of
      type "todo", with Properties like "text" (the content of the todo item),
      and "completed" (a boolean indicating whether the item is done).
    </li>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem">
      <strong>Use retrieved data to create a user interface (UI):</strong>
      <br />
      Determine how you will display your data—it could be displayed directly
      (e.g. a todo list that shows every item by default), or used to create a
      list of options (e.g. a dropdown menu that allows you to select an
      option). For now, the app-builder tool will create default views and a
      simple UI for you. In the future, our goal is to allow you to customize
      the UI further.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Interact with your data:</strong>
      <br />
      Based on your input about what methods should be available to interact
      with your data (creating, retrieving, updating, and/or deleting records),
      the app-builder tool will generate the necessary methods to enable those
      interactions.
    </li>
  </ol>
