          A decentralized web app is any web page or application where: 1) you
          login with an identity that you own, and 2) the app uses data from a
          source that you own.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="block-two">
        <h2 style="font-family: var(--ff-heading); font-size: var(--fs-700); margin-bottom: 1rem;">Some examples are:</h2>
        <ul style="margin: 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
          <li style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem;">
            A personal app that you use to keep track of music you've listened
            to, and music you want to check out.
          </li>
          <li style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem;">
            A grocery list app that you can share with a roommate or spouse.
          </li>
          <li>
            An app shared with a group of people who are planning an event
            together.
          </li>
        </ul>

          There are four necessary functions of an ATProtocol application, and
          in the next step we will build an app while walking through each item.
          They are:
        </p>
        <ol style="margin: 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
          <li style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem;">
            <strong>Login/logout:</strong> this step will be mostly handled for
            you by existing libraries.
          </li>
          <li style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem;">
            <strong>Retrieve data from one or more Personal Data Servers:</strong>
            think about what data you need in your app. We'll define it and
            create it in this step, then set up a means for the app to retrieve
            it.
          </li>
          <li style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem;">
            <strong>Use retrieved data to create a user interface (UI):</strong>
            in this step, you determine how you will display the data—it could
            be displayed directly (e.g. a todo list that shows every item by
            default), or used to create a list of options (e.g. a dropdown menu
            that allows you to select an option), or you could use the data to
            display more information related to it (e.g. a list of movies you
            want to see could be used to show local movie times or streaming
            options).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Interact with your data:</strong> in the UI, you could
            select and rearrange items to change what you see and how it's
            displayed, and you could also have options to update or delete items
            (which will make updates directly to your Personal Data Server).
          </li>
        </ol>
